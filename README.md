# Paper Simulator

Artisanal paper-making is an enjoyable hobby, and popular craft skill ranging from high-end art paper to unique personal notebooks. Cambridge has some of the worldâ€™s leading paper researchers, who study the microstructure of the paper in historical books and documents. The goal of this project is to create a physical simulator that models the fibres, fluids and forms of a traditional paper making process. The result will be not only a valuable scientific tool, but potentially a popular plug-in component to the many painting and drawing apps that offer a rather trivial range of simulated paper textures and background images.
